Description: ASTNG
        =====
        
        What's this ?
        -------------
        
        The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
        python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
        pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
        governed by pylint's needs.
        
        It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast` module.
        It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by recursively
        walking down the AST and building an extended ast (let's call it astng ;). The
        new node classes have additional methods and attributes for different usages.
        They include some support for static inference and local name scopes.
        Furthermore, astng builds partial trees by inspecting living objects.
        
        Main modules are:
        
        * `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the
          different type of nodes of the tree.
        
        * the `manager` contains a high level object to get astng trees from
          source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
          constructed tree for quick access
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run ::
        
        	python setup.py install
        
        For installation options, see ::
        
        	python setup.py install --help
        
        
        If you have any questions, please mail the
        python-project@lists.logilab.org mailing list for support. See
        http://lists.logilab.org/mailman/listinfo/python-projects for

        Test
        ----
        
        Tests are in the 'test' subdirectory. To launch the whole tests suite
        at once, you may use the 'pytest' utility from logilab-common (simply
        type 'pytest' from within this directory) or if you're running python
        >= 2.7, using discover, for instance::
        
          python -m unittest discover -p "unittest*.py"
